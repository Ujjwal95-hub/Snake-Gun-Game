# Snake Water Gun Game (Python) 🐍

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game built using Python.

The user competes against the computer, which randomly selects its move. The winner is determined based on predefined game rules.

This project demonstrates conditional logic, dictionaries, random number generation, and basic game flow in Python.

## Game Rules 🎮 
- 🐍 Snake drinks Water → Snake wins
- 💧 Water douses Gun → Water wins
- 🔫 Gun kills Snake → Gun wins
- Same choices → Draw

## Features ✨:
- Computer generates random move
- User inputs choice (s, w, g)
- Displays both player and computer choices
- Determines winner using conditional logic
- Handles draw scenarios

## 🛠 Tech Stack:
- Language: Python 3
- Module Used: random
